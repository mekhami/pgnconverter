1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Bc4 d6 {At this point we've reached the Bc4 Modern variation of the Sicilian Dragon. The players are going to follow main line theory for almost 15 moves. I've heard this called the Fisher Soze dragon before.} 8. f3 Qb6 9. Nf5 Qxb2 10. Nxg7+ Kf8 11. Nd5 Nxd5 12. Bxd5 Kxg7 13. O-O Qc3 14. Qc1 {At this point black is up a pawn, and white's compensation is the bishop pair and piece activity. We'll see here that white's able to use these advantages to instigate a lovely king hunt.} 14. ... h6 ( 14. ... Bd7 15. Bh6+ Kg8 {and black's h8 rook will never enter the game.} ) 15. Rb1 Qa5 {What is the threat here? Why the mysterious queen move?} 16. f4 f6 17. Rb3 Qc7 18. Qb2 e5 {Black feels the need to shut down action on this dark-square diagonal, but in doing so he weakens his light square control around his king, and weakens the f6 pawn which we will certainly see come into play.} 19. c4 Na5?! {An ineffective one-time attack on the rook.} 20. Rb5 Bd7?! {Black is eager for this exchange but didn't feel the pressure mounting on the kingside.} 21. fxe5! {Who needs rooks when you can crack an enemy king?} 21. ... dxe5 22. Rxf6! {How do you tame such a madman?} 22. ... Kxf6?! {After this move black's position is totally lost, so here we need to look into alternatives.} ( 22. ... Bxb5 {Black's best chance may be to decline the f6 rook in favor of taking this exchange first. } 23. Rf7+ Qxf7 24. Bxf7 Kxf7 25. Qxb5 b6 {It's hard to like black's chances here but this may be better than the alternative.} ) 23. Qf2+ Bf5 ( 23. ... Kg7 24. Qf7# ) ( 23. ... Ke7 24. Qf7+ Kd8 25. Qf6+ Ke8 ( 25. ... Kc8 26. Qxh8+ Qd8 27. Qxd8+ Kxd8 28. Rxa5 ) 26. Qxh8+ Ke7 27. Qxa8 ) 24. Qh4+ {A nice technique here. He isn't satisfied with taking the bishop for a pawn, he wants the whole meal at no price.} 24. ... g5 25. Qf2 Kg7 26. exf5 ( 26. Qxf5 Rhf8 {Probably gives black some unearned defensive maneuvers.} ) 26. ... Kf6 27. h4 {Ripping it open the Ginger way, with Harry the H-Pawn} 27. ... Nc6 28. hxg5+ hxg5 29. Bxg5+! Kxg5 30. Qg3+ Kxf5 31. Be4+ Ke6 32. Qg6+ {Black resigned here, forseeing his gruesome demise.} 32. ... Kd7 33. Bf5+ Kd8 34. Rd5+ Qd6 35. Qxd6+ Ke8 36. Bg6# *
